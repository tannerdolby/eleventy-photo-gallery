<div class="about-me-content">

<h1>{{ heading }}</h1>

Hi, I'm {{ site.author.firstName }} {{ site.author.lastName}}. I'm a novice photography and designer. This website acts as a compendium of images I've taken over the years. If you'd like to learn more about me, try [sending me an email](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}). 

This is mock text, write whatever you'd like for the about me page. Maybe add a picture or some of your recent work!

You can find me around the web at the following places:

<ul class="about-socials">
            {% include "layouts/socials.njk" %}
</ul>

<h2 id="contact-me">Contact</h2>

Feel free to reach out to me by email or on social media. I usually take 24-48hrs to respond. If you think my work aligns with your projects needs, I'd love to hear from you!
